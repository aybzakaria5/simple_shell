# Simple Shell Project

This repository contains the code for a simple shell implementation in the C programming language. The project was assigned to us by ALX, and the purpose is to develop a simple UNIX  command-line interpreter.

## Project Tasks
The tasks assigned by ALX for this project are as follows:

1. **Command Prompt:** Implement a command prompt where users can enter commands.
2. **Parsing Input:** Parse the user input to identify the command and any arguments provided.
3. **Command Execution:** Execute the commands entered by the user.
4. **Built-in Commands:** Implement a set of built-in commands such as `cd` (change directory) and `exit` (exit the shell).
5. **External Commands:** Support execution of external commands by creating child processes.
6. **Background Processes:** Allow users to execute commands in the background using the `&` symbol.
7. **Input/Output Redirection:** Implement input/output redirection using the `<` and `>` symbols.
8. **Piping:** Support command piping using the `|` symbol to redirect output from one command as input to another command.

## Implementation Details
In this repository, I have implemented a simple shell that fulfills the requirements outlined by ALX. The code is written in the C programming language and provides a basic command-line interface. The shell supports parsing of user input, execution of both built-in and external commands, background processes, input/output redirection, and command piping.



## Acknowledgements
I would like to express my gratitude to ALX for assigning this project and providing the opportunity to delve into the world of shell programming. Their guidance and support throughout the project were invaluable in helping us develop my skills in C and systems programming.
